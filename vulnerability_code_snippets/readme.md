Snippets in this folder are probably not real code. 
However, they can be used to practice one's vulnerable code review ability.

Vulnerabilities I found (might not be complete):

process_post_new_pass.py

First read through and understand the purpose of the code. Then find injection
vulnerabilities. Then find other types of vulnerabilities.

1. (Major) The untrusted input username is directly used in the SQL query, creating
a SQL injection vulnerability.

2. (Major) The password is hashed but not salted. 

3. (Minor) Depending on how send_template is implemented, there might be a potential
XSS vulnerability.

4. (Major) No protection against CSRF attack.

5. (Major) check_auth does not use the username in the POST request.
Thus a user can change the request of another user.
